# Bounce World

Bounce World is a physics-based interactive game built using Love2D. The game challenges players to control a bouncing ball through increasingly difficult levels, filled with platforms and a goal to reach. The goal is to advance through all 30 levels and achieve the highest score possible.

## Features

- **Physics-based gameplay** using Love2D's physics engine.
- **Dynamic levels** with varying platform configurations and gravity settings.
- **Interactive ball controls** (jump and move left/right).
- **30 levels** of increasing difficulty.
- **Game Over screen** showing the best score.
- **Responsive controls** via keyboard (spacebar to jump, arrow keys to move).
